SleepCycle is a sleeping assistant with multiple features, meant to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi and used with our hardware components.

Ambient light feature: LEDs to mimic hues of the sunset/sunrise using the FastLED library, in order to help users reset their circadian rhythms and improve quality of sleep
Alarm clock feature:  Arduino circuit receives the userâ€™s information from the Raspberry Pi, and sounds the alarm at the preset time using the RTC library
